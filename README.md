Overview
The Advanced Diet Planner is a smart meal planning tool that customizes diet plans based on individual needs. By analyzing key inputs such as height, weight, gender, age, and diet goals (e.g., weight loss, weight gain, bodybuilding, etc.), it calculates the required intake of protein, carbohydrates, and other essential nutrients. The planner then generates a personalized weekly diet plan for optimal health and fitness.
